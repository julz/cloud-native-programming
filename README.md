# A Cloud Native Programming Manifesto

**Status:** Super early pre-alpha strawman to get us started (is that enough disclaimers? ;-). Please open issues and pull-requests to discuss, all thoughts welcome!

## Values

1. _Consistency_ over configuration -- that is, where possible we prefer to focus on code, not CRDs or yml or ReplicaSets or helm charts or Dockerfiles. 12-factor apps and serverless functions can help with this.
1. _Monoliths_ over micro-services -- that is, where possible we resist breaking down a system in to more micro-services than required (generally, a service per team is a good rule-of-thumb)
1. _Routing_ over deployment -- rather than managing multiple environments, where possible we prefer progressive deployment, observability and feature flags
1. _Services_ over managing state -- that is, we prefer to use existing services at the highest level of abstraction possible rather than managing databases and complex systems

## Resources:

PaaS:

- [Cloud Foundry](https://cloudfoundry.org) - A popular PaaS for 12-factor apps
- [Knative](https://knative.dev) - Kubernetes-native CRDs for 12-factor apps and functions

Code-to-container:

- [Cloud Native Buildpacks](https://buildpacks.io) - Abstracts the details of building and updating containers from code
- [Tekton](http://tekton.dev) - Kubernetes-native pipeline CRDs, useful for building code-to-container pipelines

Cloud Native Programming Languages:

- [Storyscript](https://storyscript.io) - Top-level, polyglot programming language that seamlessly moves data between microservices and functions in a serverless way with zero-devops deployments into Kubernetes. **Open source** under Apache 2.0 at https://github.com/storyscript
- [Dark](https://darklang.com) - Programming language that hides the details of deployment and infrastructure ([Why Dark?](https://darklang.com/whydark))
